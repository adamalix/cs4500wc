This memo is a formal request from the developers to the client to install an
updated version of Scala, the programming language used to implement your
software package. The version of Scala on the designated deployment environment
is significantly less powerful than the current version. By using this updated
version we, the developers, will be able to build a more robust product in a
shorter amount of time. If you do agree that this and advantageous, we will
package an installation script in our next submission. The script will be
included in the root directory of the project and details on how to install the
new version of Scala using the script will be included. We appreciate your
consideration in the matter and hope that the decreased development overhead,
increased software quality, and easy installation will be incentive for you to
update the target deployment environment.
