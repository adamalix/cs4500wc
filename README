VERSION 0.2
Date 11/4/11

This is software written for the Fall seession of CS4500 taught by Will
Clinger by:

Adam Alix <adam.alix@gmail.com>
Paul Murray <pawl_murray@gmail.com
Phil Quinn <pquinn@ccs.neu.edu>

---- BUILDING ----
This software can be built by executing `make' in the project's base directory.

EX:

cd <project-base-dir>
make

---- TESTING ----
Running unit tests is not available on the CCIS Linux machines as of now.  To
test the software, you must install Scala Build Tools on a machine that has
maven version 2 or later installed:

https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki
http://maven.apache.org/

Once you have instaleld sbt, you can run unit tests by invoking the following
commands:

sbt compile
sbt test

---- RUNNING ----
To run the software, you must first build it (make) and then use the cs4500
script in the project's base directory to invoke it:

cd <project-base-dir>
./cs4500 file1 file2

`file1' is the name of the input text file containing the specification for an
ADT written in the grammar specified by the homework assignment.  For grammar
details, see Gramma section below.  URL:

http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs4500wc/assignment6.txt

`file2' is the name of the output file to which R6RS scheme expressions will be
written.  The file will be created within the directory it is called from so
long as the caller has write permissions.

---- GRAMMAR ----
Grammar for input files (file1):

    <input>  ::=  "Signatures:" <signatures> "Equations:" <equations>

    <signatures>  ::=  <signature>
                    |  <signature> <signatures>

    <signature>  ::=  "ADT:" <typename> <operationSpecs>

    <typename>  ::=  <identifier>

    <operationSpecs>  ::=  <operationSpec>
                        |  <operationSpec> <operationSpecs>

    <operationSpec>  ::=  <operation> ":"            "->" <type>
                       |  <operation> ":" <argTypes> "->" <type>

    <operation>  ::=  <identifier>

    <argTypes>  ::=  <type>
                  |  <type> "*" <argTypes>

    <type>  ::=  "int"
              |  "boolean"
              |  "character"
              |  "string"
              |  <typename>

    <equations>  ::=  <empty>
                   |  <equation> <equations>

    <equation>  ::=  <term> "=' <term>

    <term>  ::=  <identifier>
              |  "(" <operation> <args> ")"

    <args>  ::=  <empty>
              |  <term> <args>

---- CHANGELOG ----

11/4/11:
Prototype 2 of the software.  This version correclty parses all Equations but
does not yet apply the rewrite rules found in Equations.  Due to a backlog of
work involving attempting to port code to Scala version 2.7.5, our prototype is
not complete.

We have included the Scala library and compiler jars in order to run our
software on CCIS machines.  Version .3 will be feature complete and a work
around for the CCIS Scala version has been planned.

Bump in Version (.1 -> .2)

10/18/11:
Initial software prototype for first homework assignment.

---- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ----
This software was built using tools included with the standard distribution of
Scala 2.9.1:
http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads

Testing was made feasible by the ScalaTest library:
